# Mycotoxin-in-Corn
Overview
This project aims to predict the concentration of vomitoxin (measured in parts per billion, ppb) in agricultural products using various machine learning models. The dataset contains various features related to the agricultural samples, and the target variable is the vomitoxin concentration. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using different algorithms.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named TASK-ML-INTERN.csv. It contains the following columns:
hsi_id: A unique identifier for each sample (dropped during preprocessing).
Other features: Various numeric features related to the agricultural samples.
vomitoxin_ppb: The target variable representing the vomitoxin concentration in parts per billion.

Models
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
XGBoost Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Neural Network
Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R²)
